Data Transformation Plans
Data Transformation Plans
Spark pushdown is not supported.
Transform data in ONE using data transformation plans.
Plans are visual representations of data processing job definitions.
Once you have configured your plan to process the input data as required and defined the data flow and output format, you can run the plan to execute the jobs.
Each step represents basic algorithms, and data is processed record by record.
This facilitates two key use cases:
Standalone data transformation of catalog items.
See
Create plan to transform a catalog item
.
Transformation of data quality monitoring project results.
In this way, data transformation plans supersede post-processing plans.
When creating plans to transform monitoring project results, initiate the plan from the monitoring project itself to ensure correct processing.
See
xref:monitoring-projects:data-transformation-plans-dq-monitoring-projects.adoc
.
Data remediation in ONE Data.
Using data remediation plans, users can load data, metadata, and DQ results from monitoring projects into
ONE Data
for data remediation.
See
Data Remediation Plans
.
Once you have configured your data input (catalog item or monitoring project results), you can then add a number of steps, such as filter, split, join, or transform, and add or delete attributes.
You can also embed plans within plans using the Embedded transformation plan step.
After transformation, data can be exported to ONE Data or to files in ONE Object Storage or be used in another plan.
You can preview data and validate expressions in real time when working with data transformation plans.
Click anywhere on the blue banner to minimize a step.
You can then access the three dots menu.
For easier editing you can switch to
Full screen mode
Zoom in or out as needed, and use the compass to recenter when editing.
How is data transformed
To transform data using transformation plans:
Select your input data.
Build your plans using steps which can, for example, filter, transform, or join the data.
These steps are similar to those in ONE Desktop, which leverage
ONE Expressions
.
Each step represents a data processing job.
Draw connections between steps to control the data flow.
Select your data output.
Run the transformation to trigger the flow of data through the plan.
For the full list of steps available, and instructions about how to use them, see
Available steps
.
Prerequisites
The data source connection of the catalog item you want to use in your transformation plan must have data export enabled.
To verify this, go to
Data Catalog > Sources > [your data source] > Connections
.
In the three dots menu of your connection, select
Show details
.
In
Connection details
,
Enable exporting and loading of data
should be enabled.
If not, use the three dots menu and select
Edit
.
Create plan to transform a catalog item
In this example, we will create a plan which inputs the catalog item
customers
, adds attributes, removes other attributes, filters out selected records, and then writes the output to a ONE Data table.
In ONE Data you can create and maintain reference data, as well as fix and remediate errors.
The basic flow is as follows:
Add input step
Configure input step
Add additional steps, for example, transformation steps
Configure transformation steps
Preview data (optional)
Validate plan (optional)
Add output step
Configure output step
Run transformation plan
To create a plan for standalone transformation of a catalog item:
In
Data Quality > Transformation plans
, select
Create
.
Alternatively, from the required catalog item, use the three dots menu and select
Add transformation
.
Provide a name for the new plan and select
Save
.
In this example, we are creating a transformation plan for the catalog item
customers
, so letâ€™s call the plan
Customers transformation plan
.
After selecting
Save
, you are redirected to the plan canvas.
Select
Add data input
and then
Catalog item input
.
Repeat with
Add data output
.
For the purpose of this example, we are using the
ONE Data writer
step.
Draw a connection between the two steps.
To create step connections, hover your mouse over the circle on the edge of the step.
When a cross appears, click and then draw a connection to another step.
In
Catalog item
, select the catalog item you would like to use as an input.
In our case, this is
customers
.
To see how to configure alternative input steps, see
Available steps
.
To add more steps, use the plus icon in the connection, or select
Add new step
.
For the purpose of this example, we need to add the following steps:
Add attributes
, to create a new attribute in the output,
full_name
, which is a concatenation of the existing input attributes
contact first name
and
contact last name
.
Delete attributes
, to remove surplus attributes, leaving us with just the key attributes in the output.
Filter
, to filter out all records which are not from a selected country.
In our case, this will be everything not from the United States.
Click each step in turn to configure it according to the following instructions:
To create a new attribute,
full_name
, which is a concatenation of the existing input attributes
contact first name
and
contact last name
, use the
Add attributes
step.
It is configured as follows:
Select
Add expression attribute
.
Name
and
Type
: The attribute name and data type that will be used for the output.
In our case, this is
full_name
and
String
.
Expression
: A ONE expression which defines the new attribute.
For our use case, we can use the expression trim
(contactfirstname+' '+contactlastname)
.
This also trims the inputs before joining them.
There are some attributes in our catalog item,
customers
, that we do not need in the output.
To remove these we can use the
Delete attributes
step.
It is configured as follows:
Deleted attributes
: Use
Add
and select attributes from the options available.
In our case, this is
creditlimit
,
customername
,
email
,
phone
,
postalcode
,
salesemployeenumber
,
src_sys_id
.
To filter out all records which are not from the United States, we can use the
Filter
step.
It is configured as follows:
Condition
: The filter condition, defined using ONE Expressions.
In our case, this is going to be
attribute name = 'value'
, so
country = 'USA'
.
To see how to configure alternative transformation steps, see
Available steps
.
You can optionally preview the data that will be output as a result of the selected step to verify it is functioning as you planned.
To preview data, select
Compute data preview
.
Use the dropdown to switch between steps.
For more information about how data preview works, see
Data preview
.
You can also validate the plan as you go:
Select
Validate plan
in the lower-right corner of the canvas.
You are alerted of any errors, for example, incorrect expression conditions.
If validation issues are present, when you select
Run transformation
, the data processing job fails.
Next, we need to configure our output step.
You can export transformed catalog items to ONE Data, or directly to the Data Catalog.
To export to ONE Data, use the
ONE Data writer
step.
It is configured as follows:
ONE Data table
: The name of the table you want to write into.
Select an existing table, or create a new one:
To create a new table, type the name you want to use for the new table, then select
Add {table name}
.
If a catalog item with this name already exists, and you have sufficient permissions, the existing table is overwritten by the outputs of the plan.
To write into an existing table, select the table from the list available.
Select
Write all attributes
to include all attributes that are inputs to the step, without having to add them manually.
Use
Write all attributes
or add attributes manually.
These two methods cannot be used in combination.
To write to the Data Catalog, either overwriting the data, appending new data, or creating a new catalog item, use the Database output step.
Select
Select catalog item
.
To create a new catalog item, select
Create new catalog item
.
Select the data source, connection, and write credentials you want to use, and then
Select
.
To write to the Data Catalog, the selected connection must have write credentials configured.
These are set on a connection in the data source.
Go to
Data Catalog > Sources > [your data source] > Connections
.
In the three dots menu of your connection, select
Show details
.
Credentials for the connection are listed in the
Credentials
and
Write credentials
section.
In case write credentials are not yet configured, in the
Write credentials
section, select
Add credentials
.
Follow the instructions according to the page for your respective connection type in
Connect to a Source
.
To choose an existing catalog item, select the item from the list available and then
Select
.
Select the
Write credentials
for the connection of the catalog item.
If write credentials are not configured, select
Edit connection [connection name]
, and in
Write credentials
, select
Add credentials
.
Under
Data write strategy
, select
Append
or
Replace
.
Now we are ready to run the transformation plan.
Use the three dots menu and select
Run transformation
.
A new job runs for the transformation plan.
Data from the data source is read and processed on Ataccama Data Processing Engine (DPE), with results stored in the configured plan output.
You are alerted when the job is finished.
Information about transformation plan jobs can be found by going to
Processing center > Base jobs > Transformation plan jobs
, or by searching for job
Type
DQC
.
Available steps
In the previous examples, you can see how to configure a few selected steps.
This section contains a full list of steps available as well as information about how to configure them.
Catalog item input
Reads data from the selected catalog item.
In
Catalog item
, select the catalog item from the list available.
Input
A generic input step that can be used to embed the plan into another.
Use
Add attribute
to add input attribute names and data types.
Typically, these would correspond with the output endpoints of another plan.
ONE Data reader
Use ONE Data to create and maintain reference data, as well as fix and remediate errors.
For more information, see
Data Remediation with ONE Data
.
Reads data from the selected ONE Data catalog item.
In
ONE Data table
, select the item from the list provided.
File output
Writes data into a text file in ONE Object Storage.
In
File name
, provide the name for the output file.
When writing to a text file, columns will be separated by delimiters.
Text files are only available to users when they are generated as part of a DQ monitoring project, that is, as part of plans using the
Monitoring project post-processing input
step which are initialized from the monitoring project.
You can find them on the
Export
tab of the relevant monitoring project.
ONE Data writer
Writes data into new or existing ONE Data catalog items.
In
ONE Data table
, select a table to write into, or create a new one:
To create a new table, type the name you want to use for the new table, then select
Add {table name}
.
If a catalog item with this name already exists, and you have sufficient permissions, the existing table is overwritten by the outputs of the plan.
To write into an existing table, select the table from the list available.
Use
Add attribute
and add all the attributes you want to be present in your ONE Data table.
Map the attributes to your input data.
Attribute names can match the source data, or you can provide alternative names.
Select
Write all attributes
to include all attributes which are inputs to the step, without having to add them manually.
Output
A generic output step which can be used to embed the plan into another.
Select
Enforce format
to limit the visible fields in the output to the attributes defined.
Otherwise, the format is defined by the inputs to this step.
Using
Add attribute
, add input attribute names and data types.
Typically, these would correspond with the input endpoints of another plan.
Data remediation output
The data remediation output step should be used in data remediation plans.
See
data-remediation-plans.adoc
.
Example 1. What is the difference between the data remediation output step and the ONE Data writer step?
The data remediation output step writes the term and rules metadata from catalog items to ONE Data: ONE Data writer step does not copy information about applied terms or rules.
Due to this, there are fewer data transformation options in data remediation plans (which use the data remediation output step) than in general transformation plans, as it is not possible to change attribute structure.
The remediation step also stores DQ results in ONE Data, meaning you can view DQ results and also filter by them.
The data remediation output is designed for the specific use case of import of issues for manual resolution.
Database output
Write transformed catalog items back to the data catalog, either as new items, or by overwriting or appending existing items.
Select
Select catalog item
.
To create a new catalog item, select
Create new catalog item
.
In
Data source
, select the data source you want to write to from the list provided.
In
Connection
, select the connection.
In
Write credentials
, select the credentials that should be used.
For details, see
Write credentials
.
In
Schema
, select the schema.
In
Catalog item name
, provide a name for the catalog item.
Select
Create catalog item
.
To choose an existing catalog item, select the item from the list available and then
Select
.
Select the
Write credentials
for the connection of the catalog item.
If write credentials are not configured, select
Edit connection [connection name]
, and in
Write credentials
, select
Add credentials
.
Under
Data write strategy
, select
Append
or
Replace
.
Add attributes
Adds new attributes.
Provide the attribute name and data type, and define the attribute using ONE expressions.
For example, to create a new attribute,
full name
, which concatenates two existing attributes,
first name
and
last name
, and also trims the value, you would use the expression
trim(contactfirstname+' '+contactlastname)
.
For more information, see
ONE Expressions
.
Select
Add Expression
attribute to add additional attributes, and repeat step 2 as necessary.
Condition
Splits the data flow into two streams based on the ONE expression condition.
In
Condition
, define a condition to separate the data using ONE expressions.
Data that satisfies the condition is sent to the output
out_true
, data that does not satisfy the condition is sent to the output
out_false
.
From these outputs, create connections to further steps as required.
Delete attributes
Deletes selected attributes.
Select
Add
to add attributes to be deleted from the list provided.
You will only see attributes from steps which have already been connected as inputs to the
Delete attributes step
.
Filter
Filters out all records that donâ€™t pass the ONE expression condition.
To use this step, add a condition using ONE expressions.
Only data that satisfies this condition will be output to the next step of the plan.
Embedded component
Inserts a
component
from ONE Desktop.
In
Component
, select the component from the list available.
The components available here are those which have been created in ONE Desktop.
They can be seen in ONE by selecting
Data Quality > Components
.
Join
Joins two separate data flows into a single data flow (vertical merge).
From other steps, create a connection to
in_left
and
in_right
, as required.
Use
leftKey
and
rightKey
values to govern how the data records are paired up across the data input flows.
In
Left key
, add the column that contains key values (primary keys) of the
in_left
input flow
In
Right key
, add the column that contains key values (primary keys) of the
in_right
input flow.
Select the required
Join type
:
Inner join
: Only data that has a key that was found in both input flows is sent to output (records are joined when the
leftKey
value matches the
rightKey
value).
Outer join
: All records from both input flows are sent to output (even those with a key that was not found in both flows).
Left join
: All records from the left input flow are sent to output (even those with a key that was not found in the right flow).
Records in the right data frame which lack a match in the left data flow are dropped.
Right join
: All records from the right input flow are sent to output (even those with a key that was not found in the left flow).
Records in the left data flow which lack a match in the right data flow are dropped.
Specify the columns that should be present after the join.
Embedded transformation plan
Inserts an existing transformation plan created in ONE.
In
Transformation plan
, select the plan from the list available.
Split
Splits the data flow into three streams based on the ONE expression condition.
In
Condition
, define a condition to split the data using ONE expressions.
Data that satisfies the condition is sent to the output
out_true
, data that does not satisfy the condition is sent to the output
out_false
.
All input data is output to
out_all
.
From these outputs, create connections to further steps as required.
Transform data
Transforms attribute values using ONE expression language.
Provide the attribute you want to transform and define the transformation using ONE expressions.

image::data-transformation-plans-transform-data.png[transform data step, 400]
Union streams
Merges input formats of two defined inputs into a single output format (horizontal merge).
Data is read from the individual inputs (
in_a
or
in_b
) and written to the output.
Therefore, in the output there are merged-format data records, where each row contains data read from either
in_a
or
in_b
input.
From other steps, create a connection to
in_a
and
in_b
, as required.
Select
Add Union mapping
and specify:
Destination
: Destination column name.
In a
: Data to be input from
in_a
.
In b
: Data to be input from
in_b
.
Repeat as necessary.
If the structure or data type of the inputs is not altered by intermediate steps, it is also possible to mimic Union stream by mapping two compatible inputs to your output, for example using the ONE Data writer step.
This means you can make use of the
Write all attributes
feature rather than having to manually define your outputs in the Union stream step.
This functions like the Union Same step in ONE Desktop.
Monitoring project post-processing input
Inputs the data and DQ evaluation results from a monitoring project.
When using the monitoring project post-processing input step, initiate the plan from the monitoring project itself to ensure correct processing: donâ€™t add the step in the plan editor using
Add data input
or
Add step
.
For more information about creating and using transformation plans for data quality monitoring results, see
Data Transformation Plans - DQ Monitoring Results
.
Data preview
When transformation plans are run, the data gets stored in internal tables in ONE Data (these are not visible in the application).
Select a step to see a preview of the resultant data.
If the step has multiple outputs, you can further select for which output you want to view the data, for example,
out_true
or
out_false
.
The preview is retained if you close the plan and re-open it.
Likewise, after editing a plan, the preview is not updated unless you manually recompute it: to do this, select
Recompute preview
.
You can also view two different previews side-by-side using the
Show secondary preview
option.
Preview is a separate job.
If it fails, check the
Processing Center
for more details.
Transformation plan preview jobs can be found by going to
Processing Center > Base jobs > Transformation plan preview jobs
, or by searching for job
Type
DQC_PREVIEW
.
