  "content": "The component takes out the records from a queue created by the AsyncWriter step and sends them to the target (e.g., for processing by a DQC plan) in batches of 25 records.\n\nIf the queue is empty, the component waits for a record appearance for a time specified in theLatency Timeparameter. After the timeout expires (AsyncWriter did not provide the records fast enough), the target stops its activity (e.g., a DQC plan finishes). If the AsyncWriter writes new records after the timeout expiration, the target is started again to process the records."
