In\tthe second case you have to use RequiredRoleFiler in theHttp Dispatcher. You can define several different authentication methods. When resolving identity, all defined methods are asked one by one until one of them returns some identity. Therefore, it is important to put the methods in correct order.\n\nThis method is the recommended solution for password protection of access to the server."
