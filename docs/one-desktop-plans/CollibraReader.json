  "content": "The step was created to read the Asset objects data from Collibra application. It allows the user to specify the Asset Type\n\tof the Assets which should be returned and further filtering it withDomainorCommunity name.\n\tFor each Asset returned by Collibra a record is created in a plan processing.\n\nBoth meta-information (ID or name) of the Asset as well as its Attributes are returned. The data provided can be mapped to record columns.\n\tThe idea is that in the output the record representing the Asset will have the both the meta-information and Attributes in a specified column.\n\tThe step allows user to map following information:\n\nThe step also allows you to read the Collibra Relationships information. In that case, the step will automatically\n\tfilter the Relationships and returns just those which are relevant to the returned Assets (The relationship where at least\n\tone of the returned Asset is either inTargetorSourcerole).\n\nThe Relationship data are returned in a separaterelationsEndpoint. The reason is to always provide all the data without any duplicates.\n\nFor each Relationship the record is created and its data can be mapped to an appropriate columns. The step allows user to map the following Relationship related information."
