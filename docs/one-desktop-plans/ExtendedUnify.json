  "content": "Some operations in [branding:product.name.abbreviation] are based on certain record groupings. These operations\n\t\t\tthen need to hold complete groups of records. This involves the need to preserve all historical\n\t\t\tdata to allow the collection of whole groups when only part of them comes to\n\t\t\tthe input. The storage for the historical data is called theRepository.\n\nThis step retrieves historical records and forms groups \n\t\t\tof them from the repository, as well as storing them back. Moreover, this service manages\n\t\t\tcoordination between several process running in parallel and ensures logical integrity\n\t\t\tof record groups concurrently updated in the repository.\n\nSupported operations are:Unification, collecting groups of matching recordsClassification of groupsCreating of representatives of groupsRegrouping groups (adding next grouping level)General expression evaluating and assigning\n\t\t\t\t\t(not technically a group operation, but can be usable in cooperation with others)\n\nThis step works with groups of records usually acquired from the Unification process. Utilizing predefined rules, which compare members of the same group,\n\t\t\tthe overall group quality can be evaluated.\n\t\t\tGroups are defined by the value in groupIdColumn. If this value is empty (null), the record in question defines its own single member group\n\t\t\twith a group role of 'C'.\n\nThreshold for weighted sum of all tests. If this threshold is exceeded (is greater than this value), records are declared not similar (and the test fails).\n\nExample:The measure of namemm_name, defined by expressioneditDistance(pivot.name, candidate.name)is used in some rule's expressionmeasures.mm_name < 3 and pivot.city == candidate.city,and in other rule's expressionmeasures.mm_name < 2 and editDistance(pivot.city, candidate.city) < 2.The use of matching measures is identical in Matching and Unification step."
