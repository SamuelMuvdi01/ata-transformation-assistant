  "content": "The standard output for this step are data records written to a database table.\n\t\t\tSaving to the database is done utilizing the SQL INSERT command. All data is written in\n\t\t\tbatches to speed up the process. The following databases have been tested with the step:\n\t\t\tOracle, Sybase, MS SQL, DB2, Excel file (via ODBC), mySQL and postgreSQL.\n\nFor better error management, the parameterError Handlerhandles\n\t\t\t\terror situations when writing to the DB. If this property is defined then the\n\t\t\t\tstep has one mandatory output,err_out. Otherwise it has no\n\t\t\t\toutput.\n\nImportant notes:\n\nNote that when settingError ActiontoROLLBACKorROLLBACK_AND_STOPit is possible that the step\tmay end up with an\n\t\t\t\texception if it is not possible to setautocommitto off\n\t\t\t\tfor the\trespective database connection. Nevertheless, for now, it seems to be a\n\t\t\t\tspecific problem of some types of ODBC connections (writing to Excel files, for\n\t\t\t\texample). On all other connections it is possible to disableautocommitand therefore it is safe to set up the \"rollback\"Error Action."
