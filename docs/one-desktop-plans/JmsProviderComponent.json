  "content": "Sets the number of threads that may concurrently process JMS requests received from all JMS connections defined.\n\nThe level of parallelization may be decreased by the settings of the service that consumes messages from JMS queues/topics (e.g., minPoolSize/maxPoolSize settings in the.onlinefiles). If theConnection Pool Sizeis missing, the default value of 5 is used. The max size should be set reasonably with respect to the particular HW configuration and solution load. Keep in mind that a higher number might not yield higher throughput. Please do not use a number higher than 1000."
