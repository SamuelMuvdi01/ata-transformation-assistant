  "content": "Based on specified features (measurable properties), this step trains regression model and saves trained model to the specified file.\n                Each feature can have some transformations defined. Order of the features is not important, after all transformations,\n                the features are ordered alphabetically.\n                The model can be than used in Regression step to do predictions.\n                We can for example train model to predict house value based on it's longitude, latitude, distance from coast, and density\n                of housing in the area.\n\nNote:Everything (transformations and training) is done in memory."
