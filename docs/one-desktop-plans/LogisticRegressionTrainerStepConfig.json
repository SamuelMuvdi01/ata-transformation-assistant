  "content": "Based on specified features (measurable properties), this step trains classification model (predicting\n                categorical variable) and saves trained model to the specified file.\n                Each feature can have transformations defined. Order of the features is not important, after all transformations,\n                the features are ordered alphabetically.\n                We can for example train model to predict flower name based on leaf length and width and size of it's blossom.\n\nNote:Everything (transformations and training) is done in memory."
