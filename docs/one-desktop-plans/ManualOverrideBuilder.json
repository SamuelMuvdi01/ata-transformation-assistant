  "content": "This property specifies whether the file repository should be updated directly, bypassing the transaction log and leading to high performance and shorter transaction times.\n\t\t\t\tThe downside of updating the repository directly is that repository consistency cannot be guaranteed in case of software and/or hardware failure.\n\t\t\t\tFor database repository, this specifies whether updates will be divided into more smaller transaction instead one big transaction. \n\t\t\t\tThis operation mode is recommended only for full loads, a repository initialization with a large number of records.\n\t\t\t\tIn case theSave Logsproperty is set to true, a transaction log is created and can be used for mirroring, however rollback ability\n\t\t\t\tis still lost.\n\nIndicates that access to the repository will not be hindered by runtime synchronization in a parallel updates scenario. This mode is useful only with theRead Onlyproperty.\n\nDirectory that contains the transaction log. Can be used for mirroring ifreadOnly=trueand the logFolder points to the source repository\n\t\t\t\tdirectory.\n\nThis property specifies that logs are saved even after the end of the transaction. Can be used for mirroring of this repository."
