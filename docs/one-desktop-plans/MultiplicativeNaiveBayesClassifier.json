  "content": "Algorithm classifies input string based on trained model. More about algorithmhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier.\n\nStep outputs classification for all classes. To obtain for the best match class only, use theNaiveBayesClassifierstep.\n\nStep requires model generated byNaiveBayesTrainerstep. Model is composed of lookup and index files.\n\nThe set of characters can be defined using the following (for detailed description seecharacter set):enumeration, e.g.abcdefinterval, e.g.a-fora-cd-f, etc. If the character-is intended to be part of the set, it must be defined at the very end of the definition.Link to predefined constant set of characters using bracket expression ([:and:]).\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the characters \"[:\" or \":]\" are intended to be a part of the set, they must be\n\t\t\t\t\tdefined separately from the definition (not to be considered as beginning or definition set).There are alsopredefined character classesavailable.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAn example of definition:[:uppercase:].Listed constants can also be used in an \"exclude\" form such as[:lowercase:-abc:], where\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacters \"abc\" are a list of exceptions in the defined characters set.\n\t\t\t\t\tAn example of such definition:[:uppercase:-A:](all capital letters except for 'A')merging - all possibilities listed above can be combined to create a single set,\n\t\t\t\t\t\te.g. a definition of a token that begins with a letter and continues with letters, numbers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor a dash:<type tokenCharacters=\"[:letter:][:digit:]-\" tokenStartCharacters=\"[:letter:]\">"
