  "content": "RDM Integration Input is used in conjunction with other RDM steps for the synchronization of RDM data with external databases in a process spanning several plans. The step creates a shadow columnidand populates it with a\n                unique process identifier which can be consumed by the RDM Reader step. Part of the configuration is specifying theProcess Name, which is the name of a DB synchronization defined underSynchronization > Databasein the RDM model project.\n\nThe step has one input endpoint, which should be connected to a data source with one row that contains parameters for the step. The columns in the parameters input source can have arbitrary names; they will be mapped to the\n                configuration fields in the step:\n\nBelow is a sample parameters source:"
