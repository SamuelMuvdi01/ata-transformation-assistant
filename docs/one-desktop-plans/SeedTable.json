  "content": "This step transforms the values in thereplacementcolumn.\n\nWhen a first record with a certainvaluecomes, this step stores thisvalue-replacementpair and\n\t\t\tfor all following records with the samevalue, thereplacementis overwritten with the stored one. The storing\n\t\t\tonly occurs if both the value and replacement are non-empty. The pairs are stored in the database and therefore\n\t\t\tpersisted.\n\nThe scorer values are as follows:ST_NULL- thevaluewas emptyST_FOUND- the previously stored pair was found and therefore the replacement occurredST_INSERTED- the pair was not found and therefore the current one was stored for further replacementsST_NOT_FOUND- the pair was not found, but couldn't be stored because thereplacementwas empty\n\nOnly a single Seed Table step should be running over a single table at any given moment. For two or more concurrent steps over a single\n\t\t\ttable it is absolutely necessary to setBatch SizeandCommit Sizeto 1. Note that this will cause significant performance drop.\n\t\t\tThe alternative of this is to ensure that thevaluesets for each of the concurrent steps are disjoint, i.e. there is novaluewhich occurs in the data sets for more than one of these concurrent steps.\n\nThe name of the table that will be used for persisting the value-replacement tuples is derived from a global prefix \"ST\" and Domain Prefix\n\t\t\tand Table Name properties. The table will be created if it doesn't exist. If it does exist, it has to have the proper format -\n\t\t\tit has to contain a column namedvalueand a column namedreplacement, both of a correct type to store strings \n\t\t\t(char/varchar/varchar2) with the maximum length equal to the step propertyMaximum String Lengthvalue. Index on the columnvalueis not needed, but highly recommended."
