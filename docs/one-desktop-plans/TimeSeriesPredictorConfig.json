  "content": "This steps tries several algorithms for time series prediction and uses the best to predict next values.\n                All different models and their variations created from correspondingmodel settingscreate state space that is searched by a grid search in order to find the best model for prediction.\n                Algorithms in a grid search are tried sequentially, or in parallel (if parallelism level is greater than 1).\n\nEvaluation of single model instance in a grid search:First, input data of sizesis split by theTrain Ratioto train data of sizenand test data of sizem.Second, model is fitted with the firstndata and predicts the next value (n+1).Next, model is fitted with the firstn+1data and predicts the next value (n+2)....Next, model is fitted with the firsts-1data and predicts the next value (s).All of thesempredicted values are used to compute model error using selected metric.After all models were evaluated, model with the least error is used for final prediction.\n\nModel that uses corresponding values from the previousMax Number Of Periods(or less, if there is not enough past periods).
