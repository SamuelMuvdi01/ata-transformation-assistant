  "content": "Consider the two existing legal forms: 'Limited Company' and 'Joint Stock Company'\n\t\t\tand their corresponding normalized formats: 'LTD' and 'INC'.\n\t\t\tFurthermore, the following are possible and often used formats utilized by end user\n\t\t\tsystems collecting input data. These formats\n\t\t\tare also included in the dictionary (the appropriate normalized format is in brackets):Limited C. (LTD)Limit.Comp. (LTD)Incorp. (INC)Stock Company (INC)\n\nBased on the definition above, transformation examples follow:\n\nThe set of characters can be defined using the following (for detailed description seecharacter set):enumeration, e.g.abcdefinterval, e.g.a-fora-cd-f, etc. If the character-is intended to be part of the set, it must be defined at the very end of the definition.Link to predefined constant set of characters using bracket expression ([:and:]).\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the characters \"[:\" or \":]\" are intended to be a part of the set, they must be\n\t\t\t\t\tdefined separately from the definition (not to be considered as beginning or definition set).There are alsopredefined character classesavailable.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAn example of definition:[:uppercase:].Listed constants can also be used in an \"exclude\" form such as[:lowercase:-abc:], where\n\t\t\t\t\tcharacters \"abc\" are a list of exceptions in the defined characters set.\n\t\t\t\t\tAn example of such definition:[:uppercase:-A:](all capital letters except for 'A')merging - all possibilities listed above can be combined to create a single set,\n\t\t\t\t\t\te.g. a definition of a token that begins with a letter and continues with letters, numbers\n\t\t\t\t\t\tor a dash:<type tokenCharacters=\"[:letter:][:digit:]-\" tokenStartCharacters=\"[:letter:]\">"
