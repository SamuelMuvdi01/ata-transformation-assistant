Do you want to enable matching with authored master records or do you mean displaying matching proposals in UI?\nFor matching of the authored records you need to enable authoring of the records and configure mapping for the matching columns. This can be done in the model in the master entity screen as you can see below:\nCan you maybe share a screenshot what would you like to see in UI or what would you like to achieve?\nYou can also find related documentation on this page:\nhttps://docs.ataccama.com/mdm/latest/mixed-style-in-mdm.html#master-matching\nThanks,\nOliver"

        "content": "Hi ‚Äã\n@Yasharth Misra\n. If I understand correctly all your records are coming from the source system as instances. In this case you don‚Äôt need to populate the Master matching mapping. This is used only for the matching of Authored records (created directly on the master layer without any instance).\nFor the matching of the instances you need to fill Matching tab on the instance table (I can see it is done for the address entity on your screenshot). They wou will get matching component generated - address_match.comp. You need to configure matching step in this matching component and then do the same for all other entities. You can see some examples in the CDI example project.\nYou can find documentation for the matching step here:\nhttps://docs.ataccama.com/mdm/latest/matching-configuration/matching-step.html\nAlso your existing records will not be rematched automatically. If this is only development or local environment, I would suggest you to drop all the tables and reload the data again after you configure the matching correctly.\nThanks,\nOliver"

However in quieter periods a time slot can be available a few weeks/1 month in advance.\nThe Ataccama Data Processing Engines and Ataccama ONE Web must be on the same versions for it to work. Because we have hybrid deployment we therefore have to co-ordinate the upgrade of the DPE(s) in house with the timing of the Ataccama ONE Web upgrade.\nIf you upgrade frequently (for example we upgrade once a year), normally Ataccama ONE Desktop is still compatible if your Ataccama Web is on a newer version than¬†your Ataccama ONE Desktop. So normally we would upgrade the Ataccama ONE Web first.\nWe haven‚Äôt experienced any issues with ‚Äúlosing‚Äù implementation work after an upgrade. But we have had some minor issues like layout/view issues. So I recommend after an upgrade check all the views (catalog item overview, sources overview, etc.) to see if everything looks in order. Whenever we have had an issue, Ataccama have fixed it quickly.\nNormally Ataccama need half a day to upgrade an environment so it will be unavailable for use in this period.\nIf you have any ONE Desktop plans that imports data from the Ataccama metadata model, also test these after the upgrade as we have experienced before name changes in the metadata model in the upgrade which then broke our ONE desktop plans and¬†we had to correct the plan¬†to the new metadata model names.\nWe have multiple environments (DEV, TEST and PROD) so we would normally leave at least a 1 week gap in the planning with Ataccama to upgrade each environment so we have time to fix any issues experienced before upgrading the next environment.\nI hope that helps a bit¬†üòÉ\nEdit: one additional item, you will need to request new license files for Ataccama ONE Desktop and the DPEs (if you manage them in house) for the upgraded version. Here is the link to request them:\nLeaseplan | DQG, DQIT | DPE license & User License | PaaS / Hybrid - Support - Jira Service Management (atlassian.net)\n.

Based on available documentation for MDM and RDM REST APIs, the REST endpoints follow a pattern using a fixed base path (/api/rest) on the default port (8051) and use basic HTTP authentication.\nEndpoint URL Confusion:\nInitially, I attempted to use an endpoint like:\nhttps://teranet.test.ataccama.online/catalog/data/catalogItem/\n<gid>/data\nwhich returned a 404 error. Later, based on the docs, I switched to the documented REST API base URL:\nhttps://teranet.test.ataccama.online:8051/api/rest/\nBut then my Python script timed out when connecting to that URL.\nHas anyone faced similar issues when trying to access actual catalog item data via the REST API?

(For many customers, this is part of\nHybrid Processing\n, in which we process your data in your cloud, and then send only the results back to the central Ataccama platform). The only time in which data can be retrieved is during the\nPost-Processing\nphase of a Monitoring Project (or when\nInvalid result Samples\nare deliberately configured to be retained).\nAs such, because we do not hold data in ONE DQ&C, we therefore have no Rest API in DQ&C to access data in ONE DQ&C.\n(And as an aside - GraphQL is an API spec designed around parsing highly nested information - such as our Metadata Model - so it is not an appropriate tool for tabular data access in general!)\nBut for Data Masking - I‚Äôd suggest having a look at our\nData Protection Classification\nfeature.\nHope this clears things up!\nOliver"

We have a customer request to allow RDM_admin users to participate in the approval process (i.e., they must be able to review and publish records) but\nnot\nreceive any email notifications.\nWe tried removing RDM_admin role from Notifications section, but that didn‚Äôt help because this role remains in Workflows section. We can‚Äôt remove RDM_admin role from Workflows section, since that would prevent RDM_admin users from reviewing or rejecting records at all,¬†they wouldn‚Äôt be able to participate in Approval workflow.\nThe following settings don‚Äôt work, RDM_admin users still receive emails:\nIs there a way to keep RDM_admin‚Äôs ability to review and publish without receiving emails? Perhaps by checking user‚Äôs role or username in the Conditions section, so that Approval¬†workflow gets skipped for certain users?\nThe documentation for version 15.4 mentions something like\nmeta.username\n, but when we tried, RDM did not recognize\nmeta.username\nand threw an error.\nhere is the related part in the documentation:\nThank you in advance for any guidance!"

        "content": "Hi ‚Äã\n@Elena Bu\nAs far as I know you should not be receiving emails if it isn't configured in any of the workflow steps.\nYou can have the workflow work without email configuration. That is not a mandatory field and can be left empty.\nKeep in mind you also have fields for email templates within the workflow individual steps as well. So ensure that those are also empty (If you don't want emails). Along with the top level, publish reject emails.\nI can see in the screenshot it looks like you have emails setup for notifications after the steps completes, possibly¬†for rejects as well I cannot see from the screenshot.\nMake sure the RDM_admin is not included in those lists, or it will trigger an email notification for them.\nAlso if the any user belongs to multiple roles such as (RDM_admin and RDM_GEO_admin)¬†they will still receive email if they belong to either one.\nSo for specific users you may also need to keep that in mind when testing, as they might be receiving emails from another group that they could be part of, if configured that that. Example: if you remove RDM_admin from the email list and still receive email, make sure that user doesn't also belong to¬†RDM_GEO_admin\nSee screenshot below of example where you can find email field within a workflow specific step."

Existing records can be reprocessed by using either PARTIAL or FULL reprocess operation.\nThe\nReprocess All Entities\ncheckbox simply says: Run the reprocess operation on ALL entities in your model (both instance and master layer). Meaning all records in your MDM hub will be run through the processing again.\nEither use the option \"Reprocess All Entities\" or select entities to be reprocessed in the Entities to Reprocess section.\nThe\nRematch All / Selected Entities\nis a supplementary option to the Reprocess. It restarts the matching process on reprocessed records. By default the engine keeps the identity as originally assigned. If REMATCH enabled, the matching results are recalculated.\nWARNING! Performing the rematch action means, the manual match exceptions entered by any user will be removed and matching will be recalculated!!!\nJust keep in mind that the FULL reprocess operation might take some time - similar to the INITIAL load.\nBTW You can read more about parameters in the configuration UI when you mouse over the label."

      "content": "I have been trying to explore the Reprocess and Rematch options in MDM.\nFrom\nthis\npost I understand that Reprocess is used to reprocess the records. For example, lets say, after an initial load where the email values were not being modified in contact_clean.comp, we are now to determine which emails have the domain\ncompany-name.com\nand are now being updated to have domain\ncompanyname.com .\nSo, I need to run the reprocess job.\nRematch is to run the match step on top of the reprocess since the email values have been modified. What I do not understand is do I run a rematch job only if the email value participates in determining the master record or do I need to run it whenever the reprocess jobs is run irrespective of the changes that took place due to a reprocess?\nThere is another question I have. When we run a load job, the change detection is done right. Does this change detection run on all the records or just the delta records. Post the change detection, matching and merging is run only on the records that changed or all the records?\nI am looking for an answer because I scheduled a workflow to load records and export them, assuming that each time any new records are added or old records get modified, the master records will be updated(when there is¬†a change in one of the related instance records) due to change detection. I did not change any code.\nBut a new record got added and matched to an already existing master record. However, the match_rule that was mentioned in the master record did not justify the matching. I ran a reprocess and rematch job and the new record became a different master record.\nI am looking for an explanation on this and also a suggestion on if I need to run the rematch job everytime I am loading records and need to export them for downstream sources?"

        "timestamp": "3 months ago",
        "content": "Hi ‚Äã\n@aish_TF\nThis is a good example for how the different processes in an MDM load fit together.\nWhen you perform any load, the system will first perform change detection on all the rows that are supplied. So, if it's a full load then all rows in the data set are checked; if it's a delta load then only the rows in the delta set are checked.\nOnly those rows that have changed since the previous load are then processed further through the transformation layers.\nReprocessing plans are effectively a special type of load, where all the rows previously loaded to the instance layer (or a specified subset in the case of a partial reprocess) are treated as \"changed\" for the purposes of carrying on the transformation process. This is particularly useful for cases like yours where the source data is static but enrichment rules in the cleanse plans have changed.\nThe only rows in the instance layer that will be updated during a load are those that are in this \"changed\" state.\nReprocessing can be carried out with or without rematching. Any reprocess will perform the cleanse transformation. If the rematch option is selected then it will additionally run the match plan to update a small group of columns including the master_id and the match_rule.\nIf data columns are updated in the instance layer during a reprocess cleanse, or the row is rematched, then the merge operation will be carried out to propagate these changes to the master layer. If rematch is selected then the master grouping will be re-evaluated first; otherwise the new existing master group will be retained. Either way, the merge plan will be executed for all instances in the master group.\nIf your email address value is not used as part of your matching rules then you do not need to run the¬†reprocess with rematch: it will be evaluated as part of the merge plan and written to the master layer if it meets the survivorship criteria.\nIf the email address is used as part of the match rules then you need either to run a reprocess with rematch or (more likely) add the column to \"rematch if changed section\" list in the matching tab's Advanced Matching Configuration.\nI think what is happening in your process is a result of the way rows are made available for processing during a load versus a reprocess with rematch.\nLet's assume you perform a full load where just one new row is added and every other row is unchanged. ¬†Only that single row will be available to be updated. The engine will attempt to match it against the data already loaded.\nWhen you run a reprocess with rematch, the entire data population is re-opened for matching, and this can lead to different groupings being selected.\nThe possibility of match groups changing means you need to decide the relative merits for¬†running reprocess with rematch across your whole data set. Generally changes will be limited but it does depend¬†on how your match rules are defined.\nI've never seen MDM match a row incorrectly but the logic for the matching can be confusing: we'd need to inspect the rules to work out why this is. ¬†For instance, a common misconception is that match rules are executed \"in order\" - so one match rule should take precedence over another one defined lower in the list. This is not the case, as it wouldn't work with the threading model. This means you can't consider a single rule in isolation: you have to consider all defined rules as a set and make sure each is fully deterministic.\nHope that helps!"

So, they match, merge and make¬†a master record(lets say with master record id 1) that has a match rule name of 2nd match rule.\nNow, in the next full load, there is a new record added in system A that has the same name as the master record(id1) created. There is no change in the original two records that participated in formation of master record id 1. I do not run reprocess or rematch steps (there is no change in transformation logic for email as well). The new record becomes a part of the same master record(id 1) and the match rule name is of 2nd match rule.\nAnyway I run a rematch, because I do not expect the newly added record to be a part of this master record. Post that, it becomes an independent master record and the other master record is as it was before the new record was loaded.\nFor sure I am lacking some understanding and would like to¬†clear my concepts here.\nAlso,¬†I had scheduled a job to load the records(which would run match on any new records to either make it a part of an already existing master or make a new master when it does not satisfy any match rule). But now with this scenario I am not sure if I should also trigger a rematch job post load in the scheduled workflow.\nPlease let me know if you need anymore information.\nThank you"

      "content": "Hi everyone!\nI‚Äôm back with the second and last part of the GraphQL best practice series. First part was all about¬†authentication types & which one you should use and how to authenticate GraphQL¬†requests. This post will focus on¬†how to work with MMM in GraphQL - so let‚Äôs get into it.\nIf you‚Äôd like to check out the first part I‚Äôm sharing it here üëá\nüìö Guide: How to run GraphQL requests - Part I\nONE Metadata Readers Or GraphQL?\nMMM is the name for the linked list that holds all metadata and the connections between them. Pretty much everything in MMM can be explored via GraphQL - as GraphQL is what happens behind the scenes in most steps/actions in ONE Desktop.\nAs far as ONE Desktop is concerned, while ONE Metadata Readers are often all you need, highly nested queries and associated joins can become quite tricky to handle via ONE Desktop plans, and can sometimes be simpler to build by just running a specific GraphQL query. In addition to that,¬†some things, such as raw profiling information can only be extracted via GraphQL.\nExploring MMM\nOne of the questions you might have is how to get the¬†data out of MMM?\nTo find a route in the MMM model, you can either use the\nSettings panel,\nor in ONE Desktop you can use the\nONE Metadata Explorer tab + the Advanced tab in Properties\nto help you plot a route.\nIn the below example, we can see that rule links to\ntermInstances\nlinks to target.\nWhen using GraphQL, you would use ‚Äúterm‚Äù, rather than the descriptive name ‚Äútarget‚Äù as part of your query:\nBrowser DevTools\nYou can also get non MMM information (e.g. job status, audit, etc), if you know what graphQL gets called by the platform at the right time. If you‚Äôd like to explore this, check¬†your Network section under the Browser‚Äôs DevTools, which captures all web requests and responses. There are also\nweb extensions\nthat can help simplify this.\nYou can then work backwards to build your own - I‚Äôd keep in mind while reverse engineering how much of it can be put on prod.\nGraphQL Requests Structure\nTo build requests yourself, it is helpful to understand the structure of how data is held in the platform.\nüí°Some tips:\nThe root of your query normally either has to refer to a singular instance of something filtered by gid\ncatalogItem(gid: \"5c866cdf-0000-7000-0000-0000000553fb\")\nor as a plural when returning for multiple items belonging to a single entity\ncatalogItems\nDepending on what you select and how you select it, you normally have to specify if you want the published or draft version, and the way in which you specify this is often inconsistent. You may also have to combine these together over the course of your query:\ncatalogItem(gid: \"5c866cdf-0000-7000-0000-0000000553fb\") {\n        publishedVersion {\n...\n\t}\n}\ncatalogItems(versionSelector: {publishedVersion: true}) {\n...\n}\nTo get at the attributes/other linked MMM items, you must almost always first go through 1-2 ‚Äúlayers‚Äù of non-attributes, edges and node/nodes (you will have to determine which of edge, edges, node and/or nodes work and in which order by trial/error)\ncatalogItems(versionSelector: {publishedVersion: true}) {\nedges {\n\t\tnode { --(sometimes nodes instead of node)\n\t\t\t...\n}\n}\n}\nFor performance reasons, most queries will allow you to use two top level attributes called size and skip, which lets you paginate responses. This is extremely difficult to orchestrate in ONE Desktop, but when you have the opportunity to use a different tool, and you know the response from your query will be huge it is a very good idea.\nquery GetJobs{\n  baseJobs(\n    versionSelector: {draftVersion: true}\n    orderBy: {property: \"createdAt\", direction: DESC}\n    size: 20\n\t skip: 0\n  ) {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        gid\n        type\n        draftVersion {\n          name\n          type\n          status\n          createdAt\n          linkedEntityId\n          linkedEntityNodePath\n          linkedEntityHcn\n          correlationId\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nPutting everything together, here is an example request that gets all Profiling data:\nquery getProfileData {\n    attributeProfiles(versionSelector: { publishedVersion: true }) {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          gid\n          publishedVersion {\n            displayName\n            attributeProfileData {\n              publishedVersion {\n                distinctCount\n                duplicateCount\n                frequencyCount\n                frequencyGroupsCount\n                masksCount\n                minValue\n                maxValue\n                nonUniqueCount\n                nullCount\n                numMin\n                numMean\n                numMax\n                numStdDeviation\n                numSum\n                numVariance\n                patternsCount\n                stringMinLength\n                stringMeanLength\n                stringMaxLength\n                totalCount\n                uniqueCount\n                frequencyGroupsHead(\n                  orderBy: { property: \"count\", direction: DESC }\n                  size: 3\n                ) {\n                  edges {\n                    node {\n                      publishedVersion {\n                        value\n                        count\n                      }\n                    }\n                  }\n                }\n                masksHead(\n                  orderBy: { property: \"count\", direction: DESC }\n                  size: 3\n                ) {\n                  edges {\n                    node {\n                      publishedVersion {\n                        value\n                        count\n                      }\n                    }\n                  }\n                }\n                patternsHead(\n                  orderBy: { property: \"count\", direction: DESC }\n                  size: 3\n                ) {\n                  edges {\n                    node {\n                      publishedVersion {\n                        value\n                        count\n                      }\n                    }\n                  }\n                }\n                quantiles(\n                  orderBy: { property: \"percentile\", direction: DESC }\n                  size: 3\n                ) {\n                  edges {\n                    node {\n                      publishedVersion {\n                        value\n                        percentile\n                      }\n                    }\n                  }\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\nAnd that‚Äôs all!\nMy suggestion and what I use daily is to work these on the playground first, building the query in small chunks.\nHope you found this short series helpful, let me know if you have any best practices, tips, or questions in the comments!"

      "content": "Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)\nallows users to use one set of credentials to log into many different websites. It is an open standard that allows identity providers (IdP) to pass authorization credentials to service providers(SP).\nSAML transactions use\nExtensible Markup Language (XML)\nfor standardized communications between the identity provider and service providers. SAML is the link between the authentication of a user‚Äôs identity and the authorization to use a service.\nItems to consider prior to connecting to SAML- Best Practice\nIt is important to understand how your organization‚Äôs Active Directory is setup. Some pre-requisites needed can include things such as:\nDo you have a list of groups you need to import?\nIf the answer is no, you may want to speak to your engagement manager from Ataccama to discuss in detail. In short, with AD Groups we can map Ataccama Roles to a single group. This benefit of doing this is, your internal dev-ops team won‚Äôt have to manually add/remove users to Keycloak each time someone is added/removed from Active Directory.\nOnce you have decided on the number of groups/users, you must then submit a request within your organization for a federation metadata file. How long this takes, will heavily depend on your internal processes. Without this file, you will not be able to proceed with the SAML configuration.\nBest practice is to ensure that your AD groups are flexible enough to support one Ataccama role to one Azure AD group mapping. Some organizations decide to map 1 role to many groups, but this is a little more complicated. You may want to speak to your engagement manager from Ataccama to discuss in detail.\nHave you decided what permissions each SAML group should have in regards to Ataccama?\nIf the answer is no, please contact your assigned engagement manager or visit our documentation portal to understand the default roles/permissions available to you at Roles and Permissions. This is a very important step if you are looking to build a data governance process and ensure that certain aspects of the Ataccama tool are restricted for their respective groups/users.\nBest practice is to have a meeting with an Ataccama resource in advance to discuss the various roles you have within your organization. This is very important as we will need to map your permissions to Ataccama roles. This will also have a major impact on how your groups in SAML will be created and mapped to your users.\nConsider the SAML attributes\nBecause Active Directory allows you to structure all attributes at the organization level, you must confirm with your devops/security team for these attributes.\nThe list is as follows\n:\nUsername -\nFor Azure AD, this will be\nuser.userprincipalname\nand for Okta this will be based on the Attribute Values in your Okta configuration\nFirst Name -\nFor Azure AD, this will be\nuser.givenname\nand for Okta, this will be based on the Attribute Values in your Okta configuration\nLast Name -\nFor Azure AD, this will be\nuser.surname\nand for Okta, this will be based on the Attribute Values in your Okta configuration\nEmail -\nFor Azure AD, this will be\nuser.mail\nand for Okta, this will be based on the Attribute Values in your Okta configuration\nGroups -\nFor Azure AD, this will be\nuser.groups[Security Groups]\n, and for Okta, this will be based on the Attribute Values in your Okta Configuration\nBest practice is to ensure you have all the above attributes before rushing to setup SAML. We also recommend having an SAML expert from your internal team during the call for configuration, so that there are no delays in getting it completed.\nEnsure you have the SAML form\nMost importantly, ensure you have the saml form and that it is located in the correct directory in your environment‚Äôs file system.\nThe form can be downloaded\n- SEE attachment\nOnce you have all the above information, then you are ready to proceed to the actual configuration of SAML with Keycloak üéâ\nSteps to create a SAML connection\nBefore going through the following steps, please ensure you have your keycloak location (https://<ataccama_platform_fqdn>/auth). Also, upon logging in, at the top left hand corner make sure you are selecting the realm that you want to enable SAML on. Ataccamaone will be for ALL Ataccama related applications and Master is for keycloak login directly.\nInitial Keycloak Configuration for SAML\nNavigate to ‚ÄúIdentity Providers‚Äù on the menu on the left hand side\nSelect the drop down menu\nSelect ‚ÄúSaml v2.0‚Äù\nOnce selected, the following screen should appear. In this screen, you can change the alias name to how you see fit.\nBe sure to do the following checks\nCheck the Redirect URI - it should look something like: https://<ataccama_platform_fqdn>/auth/realms/ataccamaone/broker/saml/endpoint It‚Äôs important that the\nsaml\nin the Redirect URI matches the value of the Alias field\nAdditionally, make note of the Redirect URI as this will be requested by the Client‚Äôs IAM team along with the User Identifier and the Reply (ACS) URL for Azure AD\nIdentifier/Entity ID: https://<ataccama_platform_fqdn>/auth/realms/ataccamaone\nUser Identifier: user.mail\nReply (ACS) URL: https:///auth/realms/ataccamaone/broker/saml/endpoint\nDO NOT CLICK SAVE\nAzure AD Configuration\nAfter supplying the above information to the client‚Äôs IAM team, they should be able to generate an .xml file. This file should contain information that we specified in 3. Consider the SAML attributes\nTo ensure that the .xml document has all the information needed, Attributes & Claims should look similar to what‚Äôs in the image.\nuser.groups\nvalue should be user.groups[Security Groups]\nKeycloak Configuration - Settings\nNow that we have the .xml file, under the Import External IDP Config, select Import from file, navigate to the folder where the file is located and double click on it\nClick on Import\nIf the format of the file is correct you should receive a notification (see image) and the Single Sign-On Service URL will now be populated. Other settings may have been changed too.\nScroll to the top of the page, and at First Login Flow drop down, change the value to Simple Login Flow\nClick Save\nKeycloak Mappers - Mappers\nScroll to the top of the page, and click on Mappers, beside the Settings tab. Here, we will create the mappings for the different attributes discussed¬†above.\nUsername\nFor this Mapper, the Mapper Type will be ‚ÄúUsername Template Importer‚Äù from the drop-down menu\nThe template will be ‚Äú${ATTRIBUTE.\nhttp://schemas/xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name\n}‚Äù\nFirst Name\nFor this Mapper, the Mapper Type will be ‚ÄúAttribute Importer‚Äù from the drop-down menu\nThe Attribute Name will be the AD schema (\nhttp://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname\n) for first name and for Okta ‚ÄúfirstName‚Äù\nThe User Attribute Name will be ‚ÄúfirstName‚Äù\nLast Name\nFor this Mapper, the Mapper Type will be ‚ÄúAttribute Importer‚Äù from the drop-down menu.

    "question": {
      "author": "jduha",
      "timestamp": "[No timestamp]",
      "content": "Hi community üëã\nEvery now and then, we hear from our users wondering if it‚Äôs possible to spice up their Master Data Management (MDM) interface with something a little more visual.\nRecently, I worked with one of our members who wanted to mark one of the records in a group as having a special meaning, so that it would instantly stand out to data stewards. While the logic behind selecting this record was complex, the outcome boiled down to a simple boolean flag, like\ncmo_preferred_flag = {true | false}\n. However, displaying such an attribute on the screen isn‚Äôt exactly thrilling:\nIn earlier versions, it was possible to load an image file to represent things like this, but it required customization that was tricky to maintain. Plus, it often got wiped out when regenerating the MDM project. In our current versions (14.5.x / 15.x), we‚Äôve moved to SpringBoot, and for security reasons, loading external static content is no longer supported.\nSo, can we solve this in a fun and practical way?\nThe emoji solution üòé\nThe good news? There‚Äôs a simple yet powerful alternative: Unicode! Yep, instead of loading images, we can turn to Unicode characters‚Äîspecifically,\nemojis\n.\nNow, you probably already know Unicode as a vast character set that includes fonts from across the world, even ancient scripts. But did you know it also contains a whole bunch of emojis? That‚Äôs right! You can find almost anything, from aliens üëΩ to zebras ü¶ì.\nUnicode is packed with goodies, and according to\nthis Wiki article\n, there are entire blocks dedicated to emoticons, symbols, and pictographs, plus plenty more scattered across other blocks. Finding the perfect emoji can be as easy as a quick Google search for \"Unicode emoji lookup.\" Go ahead, find your favorites‚Äîthere are plenty to choose from!\nImplementation: Bring on the emojis! üöÄ\nFound your perfect emoji? Great! Now, let‚Äôs display it in MDM.\nFirst, make sure the database you're using to run the MDM repository can store and retrieve Unicode characters. This should be supported across all our platforms, but double-check that you‚Äôre using a compatible version. If you have database access, you can try inserting an emoji directly and see if you can pull it back out. If you're using Ataccama Cloud, you should be good to go since we run the latest tech stack there.\nNext, simply add a new attribute with a String type to the MDM. Use your custom logic (cleansing, merging, etc.) to calculate the value of this attribute, and store the Unicode character. That‚Äôs it! Your emoji will now display natively in MDM.\nExample: setting value of\ncmo_preferred_flag_display\nto hold the Unicode representation of the original\ncmo_preferred_flag\ncolumn. Note that the highlighted character must be an exact copy/paste of the selected Unicode character. In this case what looks like a standard ‚Äòasterisk‚Äô character, is actually a literal copy of Unicode\n:star:\ncharacter (it will be displayed by browser as\n‚≠ê):\nNext up, use\ncmo_preferred_flag_display\ninstead of\ncmo_preferred_flag\nin the template configuration and voil√†!:\nUsing a separate attribute for display purposes is good, because your other interfaces (Rest APIs, MDM exports, etc.) can continue to provide the original boolean\ncmo_preferred_flag\nvalue to the downstream consumers.\nBy the way, there is no need to worry about storage‚Äîafter all, you‚Äôre not saving images. Unicode characters take up a small amount of space: 1 byte (UTF-8), 2 bytes (UTF-16), or 4 bytes (UTF-32), depending on the specific character or set it comes from. Just make sure your MDM attribute can handle the size (1 to 4 bytes should cover it).\nFound the perfect emoji, but it‚Äôs a little smaller (or maybe less colorful) than you imagined? Don‚Äôt fret, you can make it pop!\nSprucing it up with CSS üé®\nOne of the coolest things about using Unicode characters is that you can style them using simple CSS, just like text!\nThere‚Äôs a default\ntemplate.css\nin the\netc/gui-templates\ndirectory that affects MDA layouts. However, I don‚Äôt recommend editing that file since your changes might get wiped out in future upgrades. Instead, create a custom CSS file specific to your project‚Äîsomething like\ntemplate-myproject.css\n‚Äîin the same directory. Both CSS files will be loaded automatically, so you can tweak your emoji‚Äôs size, color, or any other style to your heart‚Äôs content.\nTo increase the size of the character:\n#field\n\\\\|\nMASTER\n\\\\|\nmasters\n\\\\|\naddress\n\\\\|\ncmo_preferred_flag\nspan\n{\nfont-size\n:\n1.2\nrem\n;\n}\nTo style the character in arbitrary color just set the text color:\n#field\n\\\\|\nMASTER\n\\\\|\nmasters\n\\\\|\naddress\n\\\\|\ncmo_preferred_flag\nspan\n{\ncolor\n:\ndarkgoldenrod\n;\n}\nNow your MDM doesn‚Äôt just manage data, it\nspeaks\nit‚Äîwith emojis! üéâ Have fun giving your MDM interface that extra splash of personality, while keeping things efficient and secure.\nGive it a try and let us know how it goes or if you have any questions in the comments belowüëá"

      "author": "Cansu",
      "timestamp": "[No timestamp]",
      "content": "Hi everyone,\nIn this post, we will cover how to do Bulk Profiling üíæ\nProfiling vast databases with numerous tables can be a daunting task, but Ataccama's Bulk Profiling extension streamlines the process. This extension simplifies the profiling of database data sources with multiple tables. Instead of configuring analyses individually for each table, it enables you to import data structures directly from the database dictionary.\nBulk Profiling then automatically generates a profiling plan for each table. To top it off, the tool creates an execution batch file that can run the individual plans. This means you can perform the entire profiling process unattended, whether overnight or at a scheduled time using a task scheduler.\nStep 1: Creating a Bulk Profiling Project\nIn the\nModel Explorer\nview, click on\nNew Model Project\nin the toolbar. This will open the\nNew Model Project\ndialog.\nIn the dialog, select the\nBulk Profiling\nmodel template.\nClick\nFinish\n.\nThis initiates the process of creating a Bulk Profiling project.\nStep 2: Setting up a Database Connection\nSwitch to the\nFile Explorer\nview.\nRight-click on\nDatabases\nand select\nNew Database Connection\n. For instance, if you are connecting to an Oracle database, make sure to use the\nTest Database Connection\nbutton to verify the correctness of your parameters. You can find detailed information about connecting to a database\nhere\n.\nPlease note that drivers for certain databases might not come preconfigured with the product and may require separate configuration.\nStep 3: Importing Tables\nReturn to the\nModel Explorer\nview.\nStart by double-clicking on the parameters node and choose the data source you wish to profile (the database connection you created).\nIf you want to store the drill-through information, select the appropriate data source.\nRight-click on the\nTables\nnode and choose\nImport Database Metadata\n. In the wizard's first step, select the tables you intend to profile.\nThe next step allows you to pick columns for import.\nClick\nFinish\n.\nThis step imports the necessary table metadata.\nStep 4: Generating Profiling Plans\nRight-click on the\nProfiling Plans\nnode and choose\nGenerate\n.\nThis generates the profiling plans based on the imported metadata.\nStep 5: Executing Profiling Plans\nThe generation creates a folder labeled\nFiles\n, containing the profiling plans, and a batch file named\nrun.bat\n. This batch file runs the profiling plans sequentially.\nDouble-click on\nrun.bat\nto execute the plans.\nThe profiling plans will execute in a separate window. Once the execution is complete, you can close the window. Alternatively, you can run the batch file from a command prompt or a task scheduler.\nStep 6: Browsing Profiling Results\nAfter the execution is finished, open the\nFiles/prof\nfolder.\nEither press F5 or choose\nRefresh\nfrom the context menu. This action will reveal the computed profiles.\nThe generated profiles can now be viewed or exported as required.\nAnd that‚Äôs all! Let us know if you have any questions in the comments üëáüèª"

When I search online for an answer about an expression, or maybe an error I am seeing, I typically search in the following order. In this example we will assume I want to change a date to a string in a Column Assigner.\nI always start with SQL. So my search might be ‚ÄúPGSQL to turn a date into a string‚Äù\nNext I usually go to JAVA. Same search but with JAVA instead of PGSQL.\nFinally (and I usually reserve this one more for troubleshooting), I go to XML. While it might not be super useful for this example, there have been a couple times where searching for certain XML. One example is from another of my post on making a field nillable (able to accept a null value). The way I was helped by looking up XML functions, was that I was actually able to view the XML for the Enrichment I was creating and search it piece by piece, until I found what was happening to my fields. That post is found here:\nRDM Table Enrichment with Null Value | Community (ataccama.com)\n. What I noticed is that ‚Äúnillable‚Äù was set to false, and needed to be set to true. Once I understood this, I was able to go back to the One Desktop IDE and find how to set this value (though I admit it took a while).\nI just created a post on how to see your XML for an online service, so it is still being reviewed, but you should be able to find it under my posts.\nEnjoy!\nJason R.S."

Your undestanding is correct. If you choose deactivation, these records are still existing in MDM hub and are used in all layers (cleansing, matching, merging). The only difference is that they are marked as Inactive in UI and if Master record consists only from the inactive instances, it will be marked as Inactive as well.\nYou are also correct regarding the export - if you change exporty strategy to export all existing records, you can get both active and inactive records in the export.\nRegarding your last question - if you don‚Äôt want to delete/deactivate the missing records in MDM, you can use Delta load operation. In the incremental load, you need to provide change type flag, which tells MDM if the record is upsert (insert/update) or delete. So the difference between full and incremental load is following:\nFULL - MDM excepts all records from the source system and missing records will be deleted/deactivated\nDELTA - only the records where change_type is ‚ÄúD‚Äù are deleted/deactivated, the rest is upserted\nHope this helps or let me know if you have any other questions.\nOliver"

Tokens are then matched against defined patterns and their components.\nTokenizer Config:\nThis element is used for demarcating/splitting input text string into particular components (tokens) depending on defined rules. Every token type is specified using two sets of characters:\ntokenStartCharacters\nand\ntokenCharacters\n.\nWithin the tokenization process, the input string is analyzed one character at a time, and when any character corresponding to\ntokenStartCharacters\nis found, this character is considered the beginning of a new token of the defined type. Any other characters found and corresponding to\ntokenCharacters\nare then included into this new token.\nIn other words Pattern parser first splits your string into tokens (you can think of them as ‚Äúwords‚Äù) and they tries to match these tokens (‚Äúwords‚Äù) with components of your patterns.\nIn your configuration all patterns consist of a single token, thus for Pattern parser to be able correctly match string to a pattern tokenizer config should include\n/\nas a token character. Another solution might be to alter Patterns to include multiple tokens, e.g. a\n{LETTER}/{LETTER?}\nwill match A/ and A/B inputs.\nYou can find more detailed example in the:\nTutorials project > 06 Transform > 06.04 Pattern Parser.plan\n(This one also includes non-default Tokenizer config)\nTutorials project > 06 Transform >¬†06.09 Multiplicative Pattern Parser.plan"

The simple answer is NO. It might work only in isolated edge cases.

In that case, the truncate operation might be the fastest way how to delete all data in the table when\nthe MDM server is not running\nthere is no uncommitted transaction\nx Tables have to be truncated as well\nWhat is the best approach\nIf you wanna physically delete specific records, you can use the\nProcessPurge service\n. It allows remote applications to completely purge records from the hub. The service purges a record of a given entity by ID (you need to provide the list of IDs).\nIf you want to perform a bulk delete or delete multiple or whole entities, it‚Äôs better to create a dedicated load operation with the\nsource deletion strategy set to DELETE\n.\nDeleted records are no longer available to any MDM hub processes, and will not be visible in MDA.¬†To remove a deleted record from the repository, either run the\nProcess Purge Service\nimmediately or remove it by using the\nhousekeeping Purge API\n.\nIt can be FULL or DELTA load depending on how generic the load operation should be and what input records you can provide. E.g. if you want to delete whole entities, you can use a full load operation and send an empty file as an input, and don‚Äôt forget about the processed entities definition in the given load."
