# Configure the Profiling Step

When creating a profile using a plan, a Profiling step appears on the canvas connected to a data source. Follow the steps below to configure the Profiling step.

## General Settings
1. Open the Profiling Step Editor.
2. Configure settings on the Basic tab, such as step name, output file name, location, and default locale for generated files.
3. On the Masks tab, create or edit masks to show data patterns instead of content. You can assign these masks to your data columns on the Data tab.

## Drill-through
1. On the Drill-through tab, configure drill-through functionality. Enable it to inspect individual records that make up the statistics shown in the Profile Viewer.
2. Specify the database name, optional table prefix, and display limit (optional) to save space for large inputs.

## Foreign Keys
1. To create a foreign key analysis, select the + sign on the Foreign keys tab.
2. Enter input names and columns for analysis.

## Input Category
1. Add a new input to the Profiling step using the folder icon with a yellow + sign above the category list.
2. Configure data, dependencies (optional), roll ups (optional), business rules (optional), and primary keys (optional) on the corresponding tabs.

### Data
- Specify column names or expressions, data types, and masks.
- Configure frequency analysis using discrete, range, or group size settings.
- Specify the locale for each column and add comments for future reference.

### Dependencies
- Use the Dependencies tab to define dependencies between determinant(s) and dependent(s) expressing how often they co-occur.

### Roll Ups
Create separate profile analyses for each value of a specific subset of data.

### Business Rules
- Define Boolean expressions, which evaluate true or false.
- Analyze the results to identify domain rules combined with specified thresholds.

### Primary Keys
- Analyze the uniqueness of a column and determine if it's a primary key.
- Configure Business Domain Analysis using strict and loose thresholds to display domain matches in the profile results.
