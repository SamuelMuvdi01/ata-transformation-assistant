# Create a Data Quality Profile

A data quality profile is a summary of the state of data, which helps determine future steps and cleansing rules. It allows you to see duplicates and dependencies, evaluate business rules, observe patterns, and more.

## Select Data to Profile
1. Configure a database connection (see Databases).
2. In the File Explorer view, select one or more files (CSV, TXT, XLS, XLSX) or database tables, right-click, and select Create Profile.

To create a profile for multiple inputs, one profile file for all of them separated by input (one per table or file) is obtained.

## Configure the Profile or Create a Profiling Plan
1. In the profile configuration dialog, specify where to create the profile and which columns to profile.
2. Enable the drill-through functionality to see individual records that comprise the statistics generated (database connection required).
3. Choose between generating the profile immediately (using specified settings and opening the Profile Viewer) or creating a plan file (for advanced settings or modifications before profiling).
