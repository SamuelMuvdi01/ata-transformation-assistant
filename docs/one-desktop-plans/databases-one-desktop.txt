# Databases

Ataccama solutions use databases as data sources and repositories for storing data. You can create profiles based on data stored in databases.

## Connect to a Database

1. Right-click the Databases node in the File Explorer and select New Database Connection.
2. Configure the connection and select the environment in which to create the connection.

## Set Additional JDBC Properties

2. Specify the name of the JDBC property, type, and value or filename.

## View Table Properties

Select the table name in the Databases node to display the table metadata in the Properties tab.

## Execute SQL Queries

1. Double-click a table in the Databases node to display a default SQL query.
2. Change the query as needed and select Execute to display the results.

## Install Database Connectivity Drivers

1. Download and extract the required driver (usually as an archive) to a desired location.
2. Go to Window > Preferences > [your product] > Database.

## Troubleshoot Connections

- Amazon Redshift driver buffer size defaults to 2 GB. Decrease the size using the fetchRingBufferSize parameter in the connection string to save process memory and prevent memory issues: `jdbc:redshift://redshiftdb.com:5439/dev;fetchRingBufferSize=1M`.
- Increase the maximum memory size of ONE Desktop for data-intensive queries.
