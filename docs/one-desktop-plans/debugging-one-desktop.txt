Debugging Expressions and Steps
Debugging a Function (Expression)

Debugging a function is demonstrated using Business Rules in the Profiling step.

To debug the function (expression), select Debug and use the Expression Debugger.

In the Expression Debugger:
Edit the expression in the top section.
Enter data next to the column name.
Click Evaluate to see the result.
The Expression Tree on the right shows transformation steps and the result of each transformation.

Debugging a Regular Expression

Debugging regular expressions is done in the Regex Matching step.

Select the regular expression in the navigation panel of the Properties of Regex Matching dialog, then select Debug next to the Pattern field.

In the Regular Expression Debugger:
Enter text in the Input Text field.
Press Evaluate to see the substitution options and their results.
Edit the regular expression if needed and repeat the evaluation process.

Debugging a Step

When a step contains multiple transformations (regular expressions or functions), debug the step as a whole to view how output column values are affected.

Right-click the step and select Debug to open the Step Debugger.

The Step Debugger is divided into in and out sections, both listing the same columns.

Filter out the columns you want to see in the input and output areas by clicking Filter Columns (1).

Use the Filter feature to select specific columns.

To test expressions on real data, right-click the in area and select Import Data:
Locate the input data file and select OK.
The table is populated with the first 500 rows of data from the selected file.
