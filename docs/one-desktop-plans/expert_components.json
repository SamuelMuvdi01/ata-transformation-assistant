  "content": "ForcedShutdownComponent is used when there are problems with some third-party libraries that are not stopping \n\tcorrectly. The ForcedShutdownComponent component has two attributes:timeoutandexitCode. The \n\ttimeout attribute sets the time how long the component (server) should wait after the standard stop command \n\tis received and if the server is still alive after timeout, the component will exit the server with the exitCode \n\tspecified in theexitCodeattribute.\n\nThis component provides access to the remote (server) filesystem supporting all\n\tcommon file operations (create, copy, move, read, etc.). The root of the filesystem is mapped\n\tto the root(s) of the remote filesystem. This component adds aFilesystemnode under \n\tthe respective server node in the [branding:product.name.abbreviation] explorer.\tUsers can then work with the remote filesystem in \n\tthe same way as with the local one. This component currently does not have any configuration attributes."
