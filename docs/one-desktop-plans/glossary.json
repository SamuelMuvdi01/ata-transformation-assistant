These classes can be used anywhere in the\n\t\t\t\tdefinition, if the characters '[',':' and ']' (square brackets\n\t\t\t\tand colon) need to be defined for a particular group, they cannot be written in a \"[:\" or \":]\"\n\t\t\t\tform, they must be escaped and cannot follow each other.\n\nAn enumeration of characters that belong in a continuous range can be simplified by the\n\t\t\t\t'-' (minus) character to define an interval of characters. For example the string \"abcdef\"\n\t\t\t\tcan be simplified witha-finterval. If the character '-' (minus)\n\t\t\t\tis needed in the character group and not used by the interval definition, it\n\t\t\t\tmust be at the start or at the end of thecharactersproperty. For example \"a-r-\"\n\t\t\t\tdefines a character group of any lowercase characters between 'a' and 'r' and '-'.\n\nPredefined character classes can also be used in the following forms:[:<predefined character class>:-<list of omissions>:]. Where<predefined character class>is one of the predefined character classes and<list of omissions>might contain\n\t\t\t\tenumeration of characters (for example[:lowercase:-abc:]means all lowercase characters except 'a', 'b' and 'c'), \n\t\t\t\tinterval(s) of characters (for example[:letter:-a-dX-Z:]means all letters except intervals 'a-d' and 'X-Z') or \n\t\t\t\tanother predefined character class (for example[:all:-digit:]means all non-digits).\n\nIt is also possible to define the complement of a set. The complement of the set might again be\n\t\t\t\tenumeration of characters (for example[:-abc:]means all except characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'), \n\t\t\t\tinterval(s) of characters (for example[:-a-dX-Z:]means all except intervals 'a-d' and 'X-Z') or \n\t\t\t\tanother predefined character class (for example[:-digit:]means all non-digits)."
