# Import Terms from ONE Desktop to ONE

ONE Desktop allows you to batch import terms into ONE, which is particularly useful when you have predefined terms outside of ONE. Follow these steps to import terms from a CSV file into your ONE instance using Text File Reader and ONE Metadata Writer steps.

## Prerequisites

1. Connect to ONE. See "Connect to Ataccama ONE Platform."
2. Prepare your CSV file with terms containing the Name, Abbreviation, and Definition columns.

## Create a New Plan and Configure ONE Metadata Writer

1. Create a new plan.
2. Drag and drop your CSV file to the plan to create a Text File Reader step.
3. Add a new ONE Metadata Writer step and configure it:
    - Select your ONE Platform Server, Entity Type (businessTerm), Workflow State (draft or published), Parent Type, and Parent Property.
    - Add columns with parameters Name and Expression from your CSV file.
4. Define additional columns if needed and provide a Created Id Column Name for future reference.

## Track Import Success and Store IDs

1. Add an Output step connected to the recovery_audit output of ONE Metadata Writer.
2. In the Output step, ensure "Write All Columns" is checked to track the import success and store IDs of new terms.

## Run the Plan and Review Imported Terms

Run the plan to import the terms from your CSV file to ONE. Review imported terms and the output text file containing all output columns from the recovery_audit output.
