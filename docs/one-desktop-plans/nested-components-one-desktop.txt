# Nested Components
Nested components are complex components that use multiple component files to define sophisticated logic in a single entity. These components allow you to use predefined components to clean, filter, or standardize data while keeping the original data intact.

## Create a Nested Component
### Example 1: Prerequisites
1. Create a virtual catalog item based on an email address catalog item.
2. Install the component you want to use (in this example, ___email_complex.comp).
3. Ensure you are working in the correct environment (configure an environment compatible with ONE Platform).

### Import Component Files
1. In ONE Explorer > Components, right-click the component name and select Import Files.
2. Navigate to DQ Projects/___email_complex/components and select ___email_complex.comp.
3. Import the files found in the following locations as well: DQ Projects/___email_complex/components/data/ext/build, DQ Projects/___email_complex/components/data/ext/lkp, and DQ Projects/___email_complex/components/data/ext/src.
4. Confirm importing external files to the virtual catalog item.

### Adding and Connecting the Component
1. From ONE Explorer > Components > vci_test > componentFiles, drag ___email_complex.comp to the canvas of the virtual catalog item.
2. Connect the component to existing Catalog Item Reader and Integration Output steps.

### Mapping Columns
1. Double-click the component name and go to the Columns tab.
2. Map the component columns, for example, in_email: emailaddress and out_email: emailaddress.

### Updating Paths in Component Steps
1. Update the paths in the steps used in the component as needed.
2. Repeat this process for any affected steps until there are no errors reported for the component in the Status panel > Properties.

### Publishing the Nested Component
1. Right-click the vci_test component in ONE Explorer > Components.
2. Select Publish and set the component state to Implemented.
3. Click Publish.

## Importing a Nested Component to ONE
1. Drag a component from File Explorer to any ONE component in ONE Explorer.
2. Review and import the related external files as needed.
3. To import nested components, drag them directly onto a ONE component canvas area and save changes by selecting Publish.
4. All paths in the component are converted to relative paths when the component is published.
