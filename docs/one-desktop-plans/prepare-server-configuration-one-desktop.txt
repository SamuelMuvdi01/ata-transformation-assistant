2. Define the following attributes in the Server Config Bean node:
   - Port
   - Runtime Configuration file
   - Server components (as needed)
   - Temporary folders (if necessary)
3. Save changes and close the editor.

## Server Components

1. Open the server configuration file in the editor and select the Server Components node in the property tree.
2. To add a component, navigate to the Server Components node and select Add. Choose the component from the list and confirm.
3. To remove a component, right-click the component in the property tree and choose Delete.
4. To configure a component, select the component name in the property tree and define the component attributes in the panel on the right.
