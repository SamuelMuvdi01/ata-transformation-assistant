  "content": "Thecluster stepdistributes work of part of plan to more computers to get the work done faster.\n\tGenerally it is similar to thecomponent stepbecause it has as a parameter plan file with input \n\tand output steps. But the plan file is not run in the same jdk process as for the component step\n\tbut the input of the cluster step\n\tis split by chunks and sent to servers where these chunks are processed by the plan file and the output\n\tis returned to the cluster step which sends it to the output end point.\n\nIt is mainly designed for distributing of work of filter steps with rather complicated functionality like\n\taddress identifier. It is not designed in any way to run faster the unification or sorting steps.\n\nThe plan file used in the cluster step must have just one input step and just one output step.\n\tThe connection connected to the cluster step input end point must have the record format like\n\tthe input step in the file except the order of the columns."
